Project title: Credit Risk Evaluation using Machine Learning

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data

Datasets needed to run the program: application_train.csv (Included in the submission)


To run the code:
1. The ipynb (Jupyter notebook file) needs to be opened with any jupyter notebook software installed offline or can be accessed directly online on google collab.
2. The path to the provided dataset (application_train.csv) must be provided in the read_csv function in the Jupyter notebook environment.
3. The "run all cells" would execute all the cells in the notebook.
4. The execution time for the ML Algorithms may be longer than expected due to computationally intensive nature of the ML Algorithms and size of the dataset.

Note: 
1. The accuracy scores will differ from the numbers in the report slightly each time when the ML Algorithms is re-run.
2. if certain tool boxes used in program are not installed in the local python environment, errors may be encountered and hence a list of libraries used in this project have been provided for reference.
